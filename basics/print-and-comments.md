    # 🖨️ Python `print()` & 📝 Comments
    
    Welcome to your **Python Journey 🚀**  
    In this lesson, we'll explore two of the most fundamental tools in Python — `print()` and `comments`.

    ## 🖨️ 1. Python `print()` Function
    
    ### 📌 What is `print()`?
    
    The `print()` function is used to **display output** on the screen. It's your first step to interacting with Python.
    
    ### 🧠 Syntax:
    ```python
    print(object(s), sep=' ', end='\n')


   # ✅ Basic Examples:

    print("Hello, World!")               # Prints text
    print(10 + 5)                        # Prints sum
    name = "Aniket"
    print("My name is", name)           # Prints variable

   # ⚙️ print() with Parameters:

    | Parameter | Description                    | Example                            |
    |-----------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
    | `sep`     | Separator between values       | `print("A", "B", sep="-")` → A-B   |
    | `end`     | What to print at the end       | `print("Hello", end="!")` → Hello! |
    
    
    print("A", "B", "C", sep=" | ")       # Output: A | B | C
    print("Loading", end="...")          # Output: Loading...


# 🔍 Where is print() used?

- Displaying messages to users

- Showing results of calculations

- Debugging (printing variable values)

- Creating logs

  # 📝 Comments in Python

  ## 📌 What are Comments?

  ### Comments are lines that are not executed by Python. They help you (and others) understand the code better.

  # ✅ Single-Line Comment:

      # This is a single-line comment
      print("Hello")  # This prints Hello

  # ✅ Multi-Line Comments (using triple quotes):

      """
      This is a multi-line comment
      It can span across multiple lines
      Useful for documentation
      """

  🧠 Tip: Triple-quoted comments are mainly used for docstrings in functions or classes.

  # 🧠 Why Comments Matter?
  
      | Use Case       | Purpose                          |
      |----------------|----------------------------------|
      | Explain logic  | Make code readable               |
      | Disable code   | Debug or test parts of code      |
      | Leave notes    | Future reference or documentation|

# 🧪 Practice:

    # Store your name
    name = "Aniket"
    
    # Greet yourself
    print("Hello,", name)
    
    # Add two numbers and display the result
    a = 10
    b = 20
    # Calculate sum
    print("Sum is:", a + b)

# 📌 Summary:
    
    | Concept     | Usage                                  |
    |-------------|----------------------------------------|
    | `print()`   | Outputs data to the screen             |
    | `#`         | Single-line comment                    |
    | `""" """`   | Multi-line comment or docstring        |
